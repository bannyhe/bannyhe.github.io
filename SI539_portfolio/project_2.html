            <p class="ps">Our client, University of Michigan’s Office of Academic Innovation (AI) is still using the same system that was implemented since their first MOOC project. At present, they are dealing with over 100 active projects, the current process is hard to manage because it is a manual process, and therefore prone to human error. AI knows the need to improve its current system in order to achieve its goal for U-M to become the leader in online education, so they reached out to our team to delve into how to improve their current MOOC financial management system.</p>

      <h3>TEAM BUILDING</h3>
        <p class="ps">
          Team collaboration is essential for this project, and I am deeply grateful to my teammates who share their ideas. Even though we may disagree and sometimes argue with each other, but as a team, we always spent time anticipating what could lead to next phases and designed collaboration plan. I especially appreciate the collaboration plan for it helped to keep everyone in the same track and rhythm at the very beginning, and can easily reflect whenever problems arise.
        </p>
      <h3>COPING WITH YOUR CLIENT</h3>
        <p class="ps">Our client wanted us to help them figure out whether or not a certain system is right for them. However, it turns out what they really need is a more scientific way to trial the system. Don’t follow client’s instruction 100%. Instead, do observe and investigate, and trust the facts. <br/>These solutions accompanied by scheduled weekly meetings among all involved departments can allow for a more streamlined, transparent process. Looking towards the future in the context of the continued quick growth for AI, a technological solution may potentially be needed to be adopted, but by scaling to improve workflow and communication procedures among departments, the AI Office can create a high impact on the current financial management process in a short period of time.</p>
      <h3>HOW TO GET A PANORAMIC SCOPE</h3>
        <p class="ps">During the project the most extensive skill we practiced was building the affinity wall. By clustering and synthesizing ideas and facts in structural and hierarchical way, we were capable to get a broader view of the interrelations between the notes, and kept popping out new ideas. By using the method of mapping affinity diagram, we successfully combined each member's effort into effective and reasonable solutions.</p>
