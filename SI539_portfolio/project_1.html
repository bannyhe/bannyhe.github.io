          <p class="ps">Students at the University of Michigan need to spend some time on workout everyday besides their study. However, due to different class schedules among students, it is relatively hard to find a
            stable peer around who shares common available time slots and similar fitness goals. Moreover, it would be difficult to do exercises that requires assistance without a peer, such as stretching and weight-lifting. The overall efficiency of workout
            would be greatly reduced if one is less determined or not self-disciplined, while peers are able to motivate and supervise each other effectively.</p>

      <h2 class="row text-center">Design Solution</h2><br/>
      <p class="ps">I choose to design an interactive system called M-Fitness for my final project. The system is based on mobile application, and it is primary for U-M students to search for suitable peers to workout in gyms. Also, I included other functions like getting professional advice on fitness, and form good workout habits through diagnose on fitness data. The major functions are combined into a user-centered, real-time, unified solution, which would promote peer workout atmosphere in local community.</p>
      <div class="col-lg-12">
      <h2 class="row text-center">Competitive Analysis</h2><br/>
          <p class="ps">The competitive analysis that I conducted at the beginning of the project after problem statement, which was a valuable brainstorming and research method. I researched for similar fitness apps like Nike and Under Armor, and investigated about their major purposes, main functions, and target users. During my analysis, I was able to double clarify my problem scope, and about potential obstacles that I might encounter. However, I felt much relieved since I got to know functions that are available now, and ones that are becoming more and more popular. This step of the process helped me to get to know major features and functionality of fitness apps.</p>

          <p class="ps">Before designing screens for prototype, sketching out ideas on a large piece of paper was very practical to form cognition and explore various possibilities. Since my target audience were mainly U-M students, the brainstorm sessions that I had with my discussion group were very helpful on modifying the designs. For instance, I had many doubts on the feasibility of incorporating new modes of pairing process my application. My peers told me that they are interested in a creative type of pairing system, with certain level of guarantee of safety and confidentiality, rather than sharing personal information to everyone, in order to promote social communication in U-M community.</p>

        <p class="ps">Moreover, many great new ideas generated from the brainstorming activities with my fellow peers in class. For example, while I was brainstorming on how to encourage students to form good workout habits besides peer supervise, one of the user testers suggested to add a section to provide users with personalized and professional advice on workout. I found that the idea was interesting, and later came up with a new approach of fitness data analysis, to provide diagnosis report that support the suggestions. Ultimately, I got positive feedback and decided to include it in my final solution.</p>

      <p class="ps">On this stage, I primarily focus on the target users that I design for. I sketched an empathy map at first to clarify the major functions and get a general idea about the potential users' demands. After I conducted field researches and interviews, and interpreted all notes, I integrated major characteristics of interviewees and generated personas.
The first three personas are my target users, whereas the last one is an negative persona. </p>

      <p class="ps">I chose one solution and built a story-map for all of my potential users in general scope, and divided this map into several versions, each with a target user. This method allowed me to synthesize separate characteristics together, and view design from an integrated scope. During the process, lots of minor issues and gaps presented, which were helpful to make adjustments. </p>

    <div class="col-lg-12 ps">
      <p class="ps">The process of QOC defense is beneficial in questioning application demands, providing alternative options, and comparing with specific criteria. Connecting students in U-M as workout peers was the central focus of my APP, which addresses the essential parts of the problem scope I have mentioned previously. Thus, I used QOC defense to compare different approaches to connect individuals who have similar workout goals, which ended up with shaping the filter and category process. Eventually, it really helped to facilitate the positive filtering of workout peers, but provided a common activity that promotes long-lasting interaction, which encourages the use of all kinds of public fitness resources.</p>

    <div class="col-lg-6 ps">
      <p class="ps">Paper prototypes help to convey the design idea in a primary stage, which really made sense when my target users provided useful advices and critiques, and effectively pointed out some points that are inconsiderate in my low-fidelity prototypes. During the testing process, students sometimes had troubles finding certain features or navigating to target screens, which offered me with possibilities for further improvements. Thus, that is the reason why I decide to change the search bar into filter options as my final solution.</p>

      <p class="ps">After referring to some great mobile apps and self-learnt several practical ways of designing iOS apps, I applied to standard methods of navigation and interaction in the phase of digital prototype (e.g: dissolving & easing effect), while made use of practical methods on pushing screens. In general, the phase of digital prototype provided me with feedback to make final changes, and I was happy to pay attention to details such as screen order, font size, typeface, gradient effect and etc. Testing with other students with the prototype proved to be both meaningful and useful in shaping the design.</p>

  <h2 class="row text-center">Reflection</h2><br/>
      <p class="ps">As a user experience designer, my design philosophy is to gather adequate information by researching on a specific social context at first, then focus on its targeted users and design to meet their needs. Throughout the M-Fitness project, I practiced my skills of prototype and design by interviewing student representatives, conducting field research in gyms, in order to place users in priority of the design process, and review their feedback frequently when iterating through possible solutions. I was able to get great comments and insights of the issues they are facing, by demonstrating my sketches and invite them to test my paper prototype. Besides, by conducting iterative method to the design problem, I kept improving my ideas and foresaw meaningful content development for the final product design.<br/><br/> In the application, I tried to include unique and meaningful interactions into prototype. I believe that students can't be better to supervise and motivate each other during workout. By providing a platform where students can search for peers and seek for help, M-Fitness will facilitate the U-M community on establishing peer workout atmosphere. Also, I intend to promote the whole community to be enthusiastic about workout, and ultimately form a good life-long fitness habit. I believe with a platform like M-Fitness that gathers students together, can help to achieve their academic goal and life aspiration.</p>
